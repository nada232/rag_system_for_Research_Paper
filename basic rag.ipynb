This paper closely examines the development process of chaos-based image-encryption algorithms from various angles, including symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, block ciphers and stream ciphers, and integration with other technologies. The unique attributes of chaos, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, topological transitivity, and pseudo-randomness, are conducive to cross-referencing with other disciplines and improving image-encryption methods. Additionally, this paper covers practical application scenarios and current challenges of chaotic image encryption, thereby encouraging researchers to continue developing and complementing existing situations, and may also serve as a basis of future development prospects for chaos-based image encryption.', 'title': 'Chaos-Based Image Encryption: Review, Application, and Challenges', 'source': 'Chaos-Based_Image_Encryption_Review_Application_an.pdf', 'total_pages': 39, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}\n"

      "GOLD: Chaos is a pseudo-random and unpredictable motion in a deterministic dynamical system caused by sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters.\n",
      "PRED: Chaos in chaotic systems refers to a complex and unpredictable behavior that arises in certain dynamical systems characterized by high sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that even minor variations in the starting state can lead to vastly different outcomes over time, a phenomenon often illustrated by the \"butterfly effect.\" Despite being deterministic, the intricate, non-linear interactions within chaotic systems render long-term predictions impossible. This characteristic makes chaotic systems particularly relevant in fields such as neuroscience, where they model the behavior of neurons, and in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where they contribute to the development of new algorithms. Additionally, chaotic systems are employed in cryptography to create secure communication systems due to their inherent unpredictability.\n",

      "PRED: The main characteristics of chaotic systems include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: Small changes in the initial state of the system can lead to vastly different outcomes, commonly referred to as the \"butterfly effect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Complex and Unpredictable Behavior**: Chaotic systems exhibit behavior that is challenging to predict over long time periods, despite being deterministic in nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Overall Stability with Local Instability**: While chaotic systems can show stable patterns over time, they can also exhibit localized instability, resulting in erratic behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mathematical Representation**: These systems often require sophisticated mathematical models, typically described by ordinary or partial differential equations, to accurately capture their dynamic evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Computational Demands**: The rich dynamical behavior of chaotic systems necessitates higher computational power and careful discretization for practical applications.\n",

      "6. **High Ergodicity**: Chaotic systems often explore their phase space thoroughly over time, which is essential for applications such as image encryption.\n",

      "PRED: Chaotic systems play a crucial role in cryptography by facilitating secure communication through their complex and unpredictable behavior. Their nonlinear dynamics in both space and time make them particularly well-suited for applications such as image encryption. The process of chaotification enhances the dynamic characteristics of these systems, addressing limitations and improving the performance of encryption algorithms. This inherent chaotic nature significantly bolsters security, making it difficult for unauthorized users to decipher the information. Additionally, the development of chaos-based image-encryption algorithms, including both symmetric and asymmetric approaches, leverages these properties to enhance encryption techniques, often integrating chaos with other technologies to further improve security.\n",
